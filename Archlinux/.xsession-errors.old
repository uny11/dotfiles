[ 07/06/25 22:49:42.304 log_warn_both_style_of_rules WARN ] Option "shadow-exclude" is set along with "rules". "rules" will take precedence, and "shadow-exclude" will have no effect.

[ 07/06/25 22:49:42.304 sanitize_options WARN ] You have set both "rules", as well as old-style rule options in your configuration. The old-style rule options will have no effect. It is recommended that you remove the old-style rule options, and use only "rules" for all your window rules. If you do genuinely need to use the old-style rule options, you must not set "rules".
